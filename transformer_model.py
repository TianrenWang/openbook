    # <img src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/tutorials/transformer/scaled_attention.png" width="500" alt="scaled_dot_product_attention">
    #
    # The attention function used by the transformer takes three inputs: Q (query), K (key), V (value). The equation used to calculate the attention weights is:
    #
    # $$\Large{Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax_k(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}) V} $$
    #
    # The dot-product attention is scaled by a factor of square root of the depth. This is done because for large values of depth, the dot product grows large in magnitude pushing the softmax function where it has small gradients resulting in a very hard softmax.
    #
    # For example, consider that `Q` and `K` have a mean of 0 and variance of 1. Their matrix multiplication will have a mean of 0 and variance of `dk`. Hence, *square root of `dk`* is used for scaling (and not any other number) because the matmul of `Q` and `K` should have a mean of 0 and variance of 1, so that we get a gentler softmax.
    #
    # The mask is multiplied with *-1e9 (close to negative infinity).* This is done because the mask is summed with the scaled matrix multiplication of Q and K and is applied immediately before a softmax. The goal is to zero out these cells, and large negative inputs to softmax are near zero in the output.

    # *    Linear layers and split into heads.
    # *    Scaled dot-product attention.

    # *    Final linear layer.

    # Each multi-head attention block gets three inputs; Q (query), K (key), V (value). These are put through linear (Dense) layers and split up into multiple heads.
    #
    # The `scaled_dot_product_attention` defined above is applied to each head (broadcasted for efficiency). An appropriate mask must be used in the attention step.  The attention output for each head is then concatenated (using `tf.transpose`, and `tf.reshape`) and put through a final `Dense` layer.
    #
    # Instead of one single attention head, Q, K, and V are split into multiple heads because it allows the model to jointly attend to information at different positions from different representational spaces. After the split each head has a reduced dimensionality, so the total computation cost is the same as a single head attention with full dimensionality.

    # 1.   Masked multi-head attention (with look ahead mask and padding mask)

    # 3.   Point wise feed forward networks
    #
    # Each of these sublayers has a residual connection around it followed by a layer normalization. The output of each sublayer is `LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x))`. The normalization is done on the `d_model` (last) axis.
    #
    # There are N decoder layers in the transformer.
    #
    # As Q receives the output from decoder's first attention block, and K receives the encoder output, the attention weights represent the importance given to the decoder's input based on the encoder's output. In other words, the decoder predicts the next word by looking at the encoder output and self-attending to its own output. See the demonstration above in the scaled dot product attention section.
